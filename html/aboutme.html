            I grew up in a small city near Berlin, surrounded by a loving
            family. I share a close bond with my two older brothers, who have
            had a significant influence on my life. They are not only role
            models but also people I deeply admire and look up to.

            Something that has helped me grow in countless ways is my love for
            meeting new people and exploring different cultures. A defining
            example of this was my exchange year in 2020/2021, where I spent 10
            months in Texas, USA. The picture shows my wonderful host family,
            who welcomed me warmly during that time. This experience not only
            made me more independent but also helped me become more adaptable,
            open-minded, and confident.

            One of my greatest passions is sports. I love going to the gym, not
            just to build strength and achieve my fitness goals but also as a
            way to clear my mind. It helps me maintain a healthy balance in
            life, both physically and mentally.
